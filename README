## 🧾 Overview

**SortPhoto** is a minimalist, dependency-free image sorting tool written in pure Python. It scans a directory full of image files and organizes them into a structured folder system based on either **creation date** or **file type**.

No extra libraries, no setup headaches — just a clean, fast, and native way to get your images in order.

## 🔍 Features

- 📅 **Sort by Date**  
  Organizes your images by their creation date into a clean year/month/day folder structure.

- 🗂️ **Sort by Type**  
  Groups your files by image type (`.jpg`, `.png`, etc.).

- 👀 **Dry Run Mode**  
  View a simulated folder tree before committing any changes.

- 🧰 **Pure Python**  
  Built using only the Python standard library — no extra dependencies!

- 💡 **Simple Setup**  
  Just point the script at a folder and choose your sorting method.

## 🚀 Running the Script

Update the `DATA_PATH` variable in `main.py` to the directory you want to sort.

```python
# Example in main.py
DATA_PATH = "/path/to/your/image/folder"

Then run the script from your terminal:
# Sort by Date
python main.py -d
# or
python main.py --date

# Sort by Type
python main.py -t
# or
python main.py --type
```
🔒 Dry Run Mode is enabled by default.
The script will first print a simulated folder structure so you can preview the results.
You’ll be prompted before any changes are made.
